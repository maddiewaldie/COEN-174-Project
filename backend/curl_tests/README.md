### Curl Tests

This repository is for quick and dirty curl scripts for testing that the backend is giving the appropriate responses. After setting credentials in `../config.php` and starting a php server at `backend/`, the scripts should be run in the following order.

```
$ ./create_account.sh
$ ./get_id.sh
```
